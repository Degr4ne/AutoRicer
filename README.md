# AutoRicer
I made this script for automatice the process installation of bspwm,sxhkd,picom and polybar adding my basics dotfiles.  
The script is tested in Kali Linux 2022.4.  **Don't run as root**
## Recommendations
* Run the script in a new .iso.
* Before running the script take a snapshot of the machine.

You can make some changes to the script if you want the default configuration.

## Thanks to
[Murzchnvok](https://github.com/Murzchnvok/polybar-collection) for making that awesome polybar and rofi themes, my favorite are the Murz themes.
